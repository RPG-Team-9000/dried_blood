Welcome to Dried Blood!  

At Dried Blood, we have one objective: kill all the baddies before they kill you. Why? Umm...because they're baddies.

To begin the adventure, you will first need to provide your name. Remember - you're the hero in this game, so please provide an appropriately heroic name. 

Health Points: You and the baddies will start off the game with 10 health points (hps). Although rumor has it that these baddies do not maintain a healthy balance of diet and exercise...so you may have a slight advantage!

How Attacks Impact Health:
  1. Run Away: you can choose to run away from the baddies rather than attack them; however, this will cost you 2 hps
  2. Hero Attack: if your attack misses, nothing happens. If the attack lands, then the baddie will lose 2-4 hps. If you kill a baddie, your hps will be restored AND you will gain one additional bonus hp.
  3. Baddie Attack: after the Hero Attack, the baddie will launch a counter attack. If the baddie's attack misses, nothing will happen. If the attack lands, then you will lose 1-3 hps. Waaaa!
  

There is no rest for the weary in this game. After each attack, you will be faced with another one.

Good luck!
